Various scripts I've been using to update and modify VASP files.  If you're using it, there's a few ways to get it:

The easiest on JANUS:

add ' /home/rytr1806/bin/VTST-Tools ' to your path i.e. modify the export PATH line

export PATH=lots_of_other_stuff:/home/rytr1806/bin/VTST-Tools

should be in your .my.bashrc (without any spaces) This will give you the most up to date version of the code, but since I'm constantly adding and tweaking things, I might temporarily break some things.

You can also just download everything from github either manually or with git/subversion and add the install location to your path

either way, make sure to also set the following in your .my.bashrc:

export PYTHONPATH="location_you_installed_to_OR_/home/rytr1806/bin/VTST-Tools":$PYTHONPATH
export VASP_PSP_DIR=/projects/musgravc/data/PMG
export TEMPLATE_DIR="location_you_installed_to_OR_/home/rytr1806/bin/VTST-Tools"


I'll be using the latest version of pymatgen at all times so if something isn't working right try:

pip install pymatgen --user --upgrade --no-deps

you'll have to unload any icc modules first (' module list ' to check and ' module unload * ' to get rid of them) you don't have to load any gcc modules since they're the default

Each script has a fairly descriptive name, if you open the file you'll see a brief description of exactly what it does
with how to call/use the script.  Items in brackets are optional.
